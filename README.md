# Student teacher database project
Test Java project to practice Swing, JDBC and MySQL integration.

## Description
This project was an experiment to understand how Java can interact with a database and handle simple data operations.
At the time, I chose MySQL simply because it was the SQL system I saw most often and wanted to learn how it works in practice.
Java Swing was used to build a basic GUI for testing, and JDBC was used to connect Java with MySQL.

## Features included or were tested:
- basic login
- CRUD functions for students and teachers
- search of student/teacher records
